<i>Tonight's the night.

3
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,133
<i>And it's going to happen
again and again --

4
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:51,000
<i>has to happen.

5
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:57,934
<i>Nice night.

6
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:02,776
<i>Miami is a great town.
I love the Cuban food.

7
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:06,601
<i>Pork sandwiches -- my favorite.

8
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:16,634
<i>But I'm hungry for
something different now.

9
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,567
<i>There he is -- Mike Donovan.

10
00:01:51,768 --> 00:01:54,002
<i>He's the one.

11
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:18,502
You're mine now,
so do exactly as I say.

12
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:22,609
- What do you want?
- I want you to be quiet.

13
00:02:23,265 --> 00:02:24,808
Now drive.

14
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:53,861
Turn here.

15
00:03:23,605 --> 00:03:25,613
You have to listen...

16
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:29,070
...Do what I say.

17
00:03:40,007 --> 00:03:42,870
- Look.
- No.

18
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:44,453
Uh, yes.

19
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,893
No, no!

20
00:03:47,957 --> 00:03:50,392
It's horrible, isn't it?
Isn't it?

21
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:52,133
Please...

22
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:57,063
Open your eyes and
look at what you did!

23
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:01,031
Look or I'll cut your
eyelids right off your face.

24
00:04:07,035 --> 00:04:10,660
It took me a long time to
get these little boys clean.

25
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:14,992
One of them had been in the ground
so long he was falling apart.

26
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:17,220
I pulled him out
in bits and pieces.

27
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,800
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is --

28
00:04:19,836 --> 00:04:22,211
Stop! That never
helped anybody.

29
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:28,060
Please, you can have anything.

30
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:31,063
That's good. Beg.
Did these little boys beg?

31
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,982
I couldn't help myself.
I couldn't. I--

32
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:42,861
Please, you have to understand...

33
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:48,240
Trust me, I definitely understand.

34
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:51,283
See, I can't help myself, either.

35
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:56,450
Children, I could never do that.
Not like you.

36
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:59,760
Never, ever kids.

37
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,052
Why?

38
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:05,603
I have standards.

39
00:05:30,636 --> 00:05:34,810
Soon you'll be packed
into a few...

40
00:05:36,306 --> 00:05:40,173
...neatly wrapped hefties

41
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:46,033
in my own small
corner of the world.

42
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:52,030
It'll be a neater,
happier place.

43
00:05:55,865 --> 00:05:57,750
A better place.

44
00:06:20,565 --> 00:06:23,832
<i>My name is Dexter,
Dexter Morgan.

45
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:25,650
<i>I don't know what
made me the way I am,

46
00:06:25,756 --> 00:06:29,013
<i>but whatever it was left
a hollow place inside.

47
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:32,550
<i>People fake a lot of human
interactions,

48
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:35,842
<i> but I feel like I fake them all,
and I fake them very well.

49
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:36,941
Ahoy !

50
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:40,971
Ahoy, there, captain!
Any big marlin out there today?

51
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,432
<i>And that's my burden, I guess.

52
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:46,132
<i>But I don't blame my
foster parents for that.

53
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:49,332
<i>Harry and Doris Morgan did
a wonderful job raising me.

54
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:52,630
<i>But they're both dead now.

55
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:55,471
<i>I didn't kill them...

56
00:06:55,777 --> 00:06:56,882
<i>Honest.

57
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:00,290
You're different, aren't you, Dexter?

58
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:02,753
What do you mean, pop?

59
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:06,062
The Billups say
Buddy disappeared.

60
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:09,952
I found the grave, son.

61
00:07:09,987 --> 00:07:12,130
That dog was a noisy
little creep, dad.

62
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:14,201
He was barking all night,
and mom couldn't sleep.

63
00:07:14,218 --> 00:07:16,790
And she's very, very sick,
and that lousy dog was yapping

64
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:18,983
at every leaf that blew
down the sidewalk!

65
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:21,291
There were a lot of
bones in there, Dexter,

66
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:23,823
and not just Buddy's.

67
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:43,692
Hola, Dexter!

68
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:25,163
<i>Blood--

69
00:08:25,847 --> 00:08:28,460
<i>sometimes it sets
my teeth on edge.

70
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,950
<i>Other times,
it helps me control the chaos.

71
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:39,833
<i>The code of Harry,
my foster father, is satisfied.

72
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:42,492
<i>And so am I.

73
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:44,900
<i>Harry was a great
cop here in Miami.

74
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:48,403
<i>He taught me how to think like one,
taught me how to cover my tracks.

75
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:51,871
<i>I'm a very neat monster.

76
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:57,500
Dexter, are you there?

77
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,632
Okay, Dex, please,
as soon as you get in,

78
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:04,262
I'm  at a crime scene by the
shithole the Seven Seas motel,

79
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:06,731
and I need you here.
Okay?

80
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,751
Dex?
Please...

81
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,093
Pretty fucking please
with cheese on top.

82
00:09:11,137 --> 00:09:14,410
<i>That's my foul-mouthed
foster sister, Debra.

83
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:17,162
<i>She has a big heart but
won't let anyone see it.

84
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:19,471
<i>She's the only person in
the world who loves me.

85
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:21,442
<i>I think that's nice.

86
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:23,201
<i>I don't have feelings
about anything,

87
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:26,160
<i>but if I could have feelings at all,
I'd have them for Deb.

88
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:33,503
<i>There's something
strange and disarming

89
00:09:33,535 --> 00:09:36,563
<i>about looking at a homicide
scene in the daylight of Miami.

90
00:09:36,605 --> 00:09:39,562
<i>It makes the most grotesque
killings look staged,

91
00:09:39,606 --> 00:09:42,703
<i>like you're in a new and daring
section of Disney World --

92
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:44,541
<i>Dahmer Land*.

93
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:45,820
You better be a cop.

94
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:47,243
No.
Forensics.

95
00:09:53,368 --> 00:09:54,562
Dex!

96
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:57,902
Hey, what's up?

97
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:03,791
Jeez, Deb...

98
00:10:03,865 --> 00:10:05,563
Where the hell do
you keep your gun?

99
00:10:05,608 --> 00:10:07,451
They found another hooker,
in the pool.

100
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:09,571
- Another?
- Chopped up in bits and pieces.

101
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:13,010
- That's the third one in 5 months.
- Third? You mean there's a --

102
00:10:13,057 --> 00:10:14,792
A serial killer, that's right.

103
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:16,551
The other 2 were in Broward,

104
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:18,442
chopped up just like this one.

105
00:10:18,526 --> 00:10:20,071
Any suspects?

106
00:10:20,365 --> 00:10:21,952
Wish I knew.

107
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,412
I'm on Vice,
so Laguerta sent me to my room

108
00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:25,771
and told me to stay out of sight.

109
00:10:25,785 --> 00:10:28,391
God forbids she listens
to what you have to say.

110
00:10:28,406 --> 00:10:29,991
Tell me about it.

111
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:32,733
How does someone so
dumb get so much power?

112
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:37,050
She knows how to play the game.
You could take a lesson.

113
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:38,661
In what, ass-kissing?

114
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,222
Politics.

115
00:10:44,366 --> 00:10:48,020
I just want to catch this guy before
he kills another one of my girls.

116
00:10:48,468 --> 00:10:51,163
- You can't get so emotionally invested.
- You always say that.

117
00:10:51,196 --> 00:10:52,702
So did dad.

118
00:10:52,977 --> 00:10:56,233
Yeah, but he also said,
"go after what you want."

119
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:58,643
I want out of Vice
and into Homicide.

120
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:01,011
What can I do to help?

121
00:11:02,938 --> 00:11:06,370
You get these hunches, you know,
with these types of murders.

122
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:10,760
- Only sometimes.
- Well, see if you get one this time.

123
00:11:10,965 --> 00:11:12,573
And can I bounce some
ideas off of you later?

124
00:11:12,595 --> 00:11:14,502
You know I always get smarter
when I'm talking to you.

125
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:16,932
You just need a little
more confidence.

126
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:25,041
All right, I'll take a look.

127
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:27,880
In the meantime, avoid Laguerta
and talk to Captain Matthews.

128
00:11:27,908 --> 00:11:30,340
He and dad were tight.
Maybe he'll put you on the case.

129
00:11:30,446 --> 00:11:32,831
You're making me
smarter already, see?

130
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:35,702
And keep the sex suit on when
you talk to the Captain.

131
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,210
It'll help your cause.

132
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:53,302
-  That's a nice haircut, Masuoka.
- Saw your sister.

133
00:11:53,668 --> 00:11:55,641
- Damn, looking hot.
- Yeah, she should.

134
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:57,310
It's hot as hell out here.

135
00:11:57,768 --> 00:12:00,091
So... Why are you here?

136
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:02,443
- It's a crime scene.
- Yeah.

137
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:04,000
- But you do blood spatter.
- So?

138
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,592
So?...
There's no blood here.

139
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:11,411
- What was that?
- Yeah. There's no blood in or on

140
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:15,252
or near the body at all.
It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

141
00:12:15,357 --> 00:12:17,390
Hey,  Angel, let's show him.

142
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:18,820
<i>No blood.

143
00:12:18,886 --> 00:12:23,201
<i>No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood.
No blood at all.

144
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:28,032
<i>Why hadn't I thought of that?
No blood.

145
00:12:29,805 --> 00:12:32,169
<i>What a beautiful idea!

146
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:34,208
How is he doing ? How does the
killer get rid of the blood?

147
00:12:34,227 --> 00:12:37,650
It's hard to say.
The body's in good shape.

148
00:12:37,835 --> 00:12:40,183
She got a nice ass, too.

149
00:12:40,438 --> 00:12:43,231
Head is over there,
if you want to take a look.

150
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:46,031
- This is unique.
- No shit.

151
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:47,983
And no prints, either.

152
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:53,661
<i>I've never seen such clean,
dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

153
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:54,753
<i>Wonderful.

154
00:12:54,878 --> 00:12:56,451
Very clean.

155
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:59,312
Yeah, but he didn't finish.
No terminó.

156
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:02,610
- It looks pretty completo to me, Angel.
- No, no. Look.

157
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:07,211
He cut the leg in four pieces,
almost like using a ruler.

158
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:10,792
But this leg is
in three pieces.

159
00:13:13,136 --> 00:13:16,401
Now, look, he started to make
a fourth cut but stopped.

160
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:19,331
- It's possible he got interrupted.
- Laguerta's looking for a witness,

161
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,103
working on the motel
porter back there.

162
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:22,332
God help him.

163
00:13:25,206 --> 00:13:26,560
<i>No blood.

164
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:28,933
<i>I can't think.
I have to get out of here.

165
00:13:30,037 --> 00:13:33,580
Dex, ¿dónde va?
Where are you going?

166
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:37,201
Hey, no blood...
No trabajo.

167
00:13:47,867 --> 00:13:50,611
<i>I wish she'd stop that.
It's one of those mating rituals

168
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:53,002
<i>which I really
don't understand.

169
00:13:59,536 --> 00:14:02,430
<i>But that bloodless body --

170
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,960
<i>this guy may have exceeded
my own abilities.

171
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:13,090
- Morning, Dex.
- Morning.

172
00:14:16,737 --> 00:14:19,932
- Hey, Dex.
- Hey, Sue. Dan.

173
00:14:19,965 --> 00:14:25,233
- How are the families?
- Good. You?

174
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:28,813
- See you at the next bloodbath?
- Never miss a party.

175
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,700
Thanks.

176
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:36,450
<i>Salt of the earth, these people,
and they work hard.

177
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:39,500
<i>But with the solve rate
for murders at about 20%,

178
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:44,333
<i>Miami is a great place for me,
a great place for me to hone my craft.

179
00:14:44,436 --> 00:14:46,101
<i>Viva Miami.

180
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:47,761
Dex.

181
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:51,902
- I like your other outfit better.
- You're a sick bastard. Guess what.

182
00:14:51,968 --> 00:14:54,203
Sex suit worked.
Captain put me on the case.

183
00:14:54,237 --> 00:14:57,400
Laguerta wasn't happy,
but she needs to get laid.

184
00:14:57,538 --> 00:15:02,553
- I guess. So congrats!
- So you got any ideas yet?

185
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:03,703
Nope.

186
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:06,771
Well, start working on
your mental autopsy

187
00:15:06,808 --> 00:15:10,003
'cause I could use your theories.
And thanks for the fucking doughnut.

188
00:15:10,038 --> 00:15:11,931
I got to go.

189
00:15:14,406 --> 00:15:15,630
Doughnut?

190
00:15:19,535 --> 00:15:21,600
You keeping your
fingernails clean?

191
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:23,761
Never leave home without
my rubber gloves.

192
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:25,201
Good boy.

193
00:15:27,906 --> 00:15:29,831
So, anything new?

194
00:15:38,435 --> 00:15:40,133
One of these days
you're gonna tell me.

195
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:41,222
I already told you.

196
00:15:41,235 --> 00:15:43,342
Blood spatter doesn't
take up all my time.

197
00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:46,961
I like doing it. Maybe I can help out.
It fills my nights.

198
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:51,000
- You have a morbid sense of fun.
- That's probably true.

199
00:15:52,138 --> 00:15:56,330
- You should find a pretty girl.
- I found you.

200
00:15:56,436 --> 00:16:01,603
Charming like your father.
Just don't get me fired.

201
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,440
Then who would I
bring doughnuts to?

202
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:13,043
- Angel, ¿una más?
- Gracias.

203
00:16:13,268 --> 00:16:14,482
De nada.

204
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:18,820
<i>Just like me...

205
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:20,800
<i>Empty inside.

206
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:36,732
- Where the hell you been?
- Crime scene.

207
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:38,731
What about these?

208
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:41,632
The hotel cokehead murders,
this dealer and the girl?

209
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,900
Well, this hallmark-looking couple

210
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:47,363
didn't die by the hands
of a professional.

211
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:51,361
No, this is child's play.
Messy work --

212
00:16:51,566 --> 00:16:53,972
All that blood on the walls
looks like a finger painting.

213
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:57,001
You give me the fucking creeps,
you know that, Dexter?

214
00:16:57,038 --> 00:17:00,033
Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

215
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:04,462
- Fuck you.
- Okay.

216
00:17:04,508 --> 00:17:06,301
Is there something I can do?

217
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:08,602
You can give me a fucking analysis
on the blood spatter on this killings.

218
00:17:08,635 --> 00:17:11,530
You think I'm here to invite
you to my nephew's bris?

219
00:17:11,837 --> 00:17:13,603
I didn't know you were Jewish.

220
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:15,963
Shut the fuck up and
write your report already.

221
00:17:16,008 --> 00:17:17,833
Don't even know why I need you.

222
00:17:17,865 --> 00:17:20,010
Grab a crayon, psycho,
and scribble this down.

223
00:17:20,058 --> 00:17:21,993
Rival dealer came in.
Two scumbags slashed to hell,

224
00:17:22,097 --> 00:17:23,931
dealer stole the drugs.

225
00:17:23,966 --> 00:17:27,231
Wham, bam, done.
And I don't give a shit what you say

226
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,771
because that's what happened
and that's who I'm looking for.

227
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:33,630
Hey, we are looking for a
motherfucking thief dealer.

228
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:37,463
- You got it?
- Okay. Sure.

229
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:42,100
I guess.
But I should get over there.

230
00:17:42,505 --> 00:17:45,073
Then get over there already,
you fucking weirdo.

231
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:49,230
- I need it quick.
- I'm on it, sergeant.

232
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:56,782
<i>The only real question I have is why,
in a building full of cops,

233
00:17:56,808 --> 00:18:00,433
<i>all supposedly with a keen
insight into the human soul,

234
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:05,603
<i>is Doakes the only one who
gets the creeps from me?

235
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:11,142
- So this killer used a sword?
- No.

236
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:14,493
Probably a very sharp knife.

237
00:18:14,606 --> 00:18:18,333
Look at the blood spatter.
Look at the patterns.

238
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:19,761
It tells a story.

239
00:18:19,805 --> 00:18:21,400
You see this big pond
of blood right there?

240
00:18:21,436 --> 00:18:23,362
That's from the initial stab.

241
00:18:23,405 --> 00:18:26,661
The male victim was
standing right here,

242
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:29,630
and  the killer plunged his
knife into the shoulder,

243
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:32,003
severing the carotid artery,
and -- blpph

244
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:35,270
- Notice the long, thick, heavy drips?
- Yeah, nice.

245
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:38,903
Now, over here, you have nice,
clean sprays of blood,

246
00:18:38,948 --> 00:18:40,661
that can only happen when
you're holding something light

247
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:43,723
and moving quick --
nice, sharp slices through the body.

248
00:18:43,738 --> 00:18:48,451
No splashes, no drips.
Clean and easy.

249
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:52,831
This guy knew how to use a blade.

250
00:18:54,248 --> 00:18:56,372
So we're looking for a sushi chef.

251
00:18:57,745 --> 00:18:59,333
Yeah, sushi chef is possible.

252
00:18:59,368 --> 00:19:03,263
Wouldn't be my first choice,
but, hey, you never know.

253
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,160
- Now what?
- Now I eat!

254
00:19:07,206 --> 00:19:09,330
<i>The problem with
eating and driving,

255
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:11,631
<i>which I love to do,
is not being able to employ

256
00:19:11,665 --> 00:19:13,731
<i>the 10:00-2:00 hand
position on the wheel.

257
00:19:13,768 --> 00:19:16,900
<i>It's a matter of public safety.

258
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:20,740
<i>But there's always a sacrifice.

259
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:30,830
<i>This  guy, Jamie Jaworski.

260
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:34,230
<i>Six months ago, I think he fell
in love with a pretty brunette,

261
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:36,501
<i>Mrs. Jane Saunders --

262
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:40,163
<i>A sweet mother of two married
to a successful banker --

263
00:19:40,206 --> 00:19:43,802
<i>All living a pleasant life until she,
unfortunately, disappeared,

264
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:47,860
<i>leaving the kids emotionally
devastated forever.

265
00:19:51,568 --> 00:19:53,862
<i>The cops arrested
my favorite valet,

266
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:57,130
<i>but his lawyer got him off
on a faulty search warrant.

267
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:03,702
<i>It's a good thing I
don't bother with them.

268
00:20:55,565 --> 00:20:59,903
<i>Animals don't like me,
especially dogs.

269
00:20:59,937 --> 00:21:01,763
<i>I don't think they approve

270
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:04,733
<i>of what I sometimes
do to their masters.

271
00:21:04,768 --> 00:21:10,200
<i>That dog recognizes me as easily
as I can recognize Jaworski

272
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:12,700
<i>or any other killer.

273
00:21:36,206 --> 00:21:39,501
<i>Interesting taste
in literature.

274
00:21:39,535 --> 00:21:42,830
<i>His needs are evolving,
turning violent.

275
00:21:42,865 --> 00:21:45,963
<i>He's on the fast track.

276
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:49,102
Have you ever wanted
to kill anything else?

277
00:21:49,136 --> 00:21:52,561
You know,
something bigger than a dog?

278
00:21:54,607 --> 00:21:59,230
- Yes.
- Like a person?

279
00:21:59,265 --> 00:22:02,061
Yeah, but no one in particular.

280
00:22:04,237 --> 00:22:06,561
Why didn't you?

281
00:22:08,836 --> 00:22:11,430
I thought you and
mom wouldn't like it.

282
00:22:20,936 --> 00:22:22,860
Come here.

283
00:22:31,357 --> 00:22:34,700
<i>Friday night.
Date night in Miami.

284
00:22:35,108 --> 00:22:37,202
<i>Every night is
a date night in Miami,

285
00:22:37,265 --> 00:22:40,000
<i>and everyone's having sex.

286
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,090
<i>But for me, sex never
enters into it.

287
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,003
<i>I don't understand sex.

288
00:22:45,707 --> 00:22:48,112
<i>Not that I have
anything against women,

289
00:22:48,217 --> 00:22:50,400
<i>and I certainly have an
appropriate sensibility about men,

290
00:22:50,426 --> 00:22:54,070
<i>but when it comes to
the actual act of sex,

291
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:57,413
<i>it's always just seemed so...

292
00:22:58,356 --> 00:23:00,401
<i>undignified.

293
00:23:01,736 --> 00:23:03,360
<i>But I have to play the game.

294
00:23:03,286 --> 00:23:05,763
<i>And after years of
trying to look normal,

295
00:23:05,797 --> 00:23:08,361
<i>I think I met the
right woman for me.

296
00:23:08,706 --> 00:23:11,701
<i>Deb saved her life on a
domestic-dispute call,

297
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:13,202
<i>introduced us,

298
00:23:13,246 --> 00:23:15,983
<i>and we've been dating
for six months now.

299
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:21,603
<i>She's perfect because Rita is,
in her own way, as damaged as me.

300
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:24,001
I'm running late.
I'll just be a sec.

301
00:23:24,165 --> 00:23:27,651
- I have to change.
- Okeydoke.

302
00:23:34,005 --> 00:23:35,533
Hi, Dexter.

303
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:38,530
May I say that you look
lovely this evening?

304
00:23:38,568 --> 00:23:40,333
Okay.

305
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:45,100
Master Cody, handsome as ever.
High five.

306
00:23:52,407 --> 00:23:54,731
Do the space shuttle.

307
00:23:57,237 --> 00:24:02,561
Vanilla... Chocolate,
and strawberry.

308
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:06,001
- No coffee?
- Which one do you think melts faster?

309
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:08,760
Ready?

310
00:24:09,927 --> 00:24:12,020
<i>Rita's ex-hubby,
the crack addict,

311
00:24:12,105 --> 00:24:16,030
<i>repeatedly raped her,
knocked her around.

312
00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:20,960
<i>Ever since then, she's been
completely uninterested in sex.

313
00:24:22,036 --> 00:24:24,090
<i>That works for me.

314
00:24:24,967 --> 00:24:26,482
Will you be back?

315
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:29,501
- Of course I'll be back.
- I meant Dexter.

316
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:32,523
- You'll be asleep.
- No, I won't.

317
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:34,302
Then I'll stop in and
we'll all play cards.

318
00:24:34,337 --> 00:24:35,761
Texas Hold 'em?

319
00:24:37,405 --> 00:24:39,962
Give mommy a kiss.

320
00:24:41,236 --> 00:24:43,902
- Ready?
- Yeah.

321
00:24:56,437 --> 00:24:59,403
<i>Needless to say,
I have some unusual habits,

322
00:24:59,436 --> 00:25:01,402
<i>yet all these socially
acceptable people

323
00:25:01,436 --> 00:25:04,883
<i>can't wait to pick up hammers and
publicly smash their food to bits.

324
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:13,131
<i>Normal people are so hostile...
But not her.

325
00:25:33,838 --> 00:25:35,600
Where are we going?

326
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,860
They might need me.

327
00:25:42,765 --> 00:25:45,800
Just stay right there.
I'll be right back.

328
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:11,931
- Son of a whore.
- Who?

329
00:26:11,965 --> 00:26:14,661
Talking about this hijo de puta,
this asshole killer,

330
00:26:14,935 --> 00:26:17,783
this maricón savage who makes
us work on a Friday night.

331
00:26:18,265 --> 00:26:21,260
Only Mondays through Thursdays --
that's what I always say.

332
00:26:21,368 --> 00:26:25,712
Of course, coño, be reasonable.
Who wants to work on a Friday night?

333
00:26:25,868 --> 00:26:27,830
I have my needs.

334
00:26:30,206 --> 00:26:32,503
So, ¿cómo estás?
What are you doing here?

335
00:26:32,535 --> 00:26:35,262
I was in the neighborhood.
I'm on a date.

336
00:26:35,307 --> 00:26:39,361
- A date? Nice.
- Same guy, same pattern.

337
00:26:39,406 --> 00:26:44,333
Bone dry. No blood again.
Pero mira esto.

338
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:46,801
There's some small differences
in the cuts this time.

339
00:26:46,835 --> 00:26:50,460
Over here -- rough,
almost emotion.

340
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:53,531
Then over here,
not so much.

341
00:26:53,668 --> 00:26:57,452
- And then over here -- clean.
- Muy bien.

342
00:26:57,665 --> 00:27:00,100
Yeah, nice.
But look at this.

343
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:02,760
All bone.

344
00:27:02,806 --> 00:27:06,660
The killer flayed the skin,
the flesh, completely off.

345
00:27:06,706 --> 00:27:10,051
- Now, why would he do that?
- He's experimenting.

346
00:27:10,138 --> 00:27:11,730
He's trying to
find the right way.

347
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:14,960
Is he experimenting
with the head, too?

348
00:27:15,638 --> 00:27:16,502
What do you mean?

349
00:27:16,536 --> 00:27:19,260
La bestia left her tits
and took her fucking head.

350
00:27:19,307 --> 00:27:21,701
I don't find anyone
around here.

351
00:27:21,735 --> 00:27:23,471
And God only knows what
he's doing with it.

352
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:26,402
<i>He's certainly
raising the bar. Damn!

353
00:27:26,837 --> 00:27:28,962
<i>This guy is good.

354
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:34,900
- Will they catch him soon?
- I doubt it.

355
00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:39,961
The killer is an artist.

356
00:27:40,905 --> 00:27:43,441
What do you mean?

357
00:27:44,305 --> 00:27:47,331
His technique...

358
00:27:48,507 --> 00:27:49,963
is  incredible.

359
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:59,710
I'm sorry.
I don't think I want to.

360
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:04,262
I mean, I'm --
I'm not ready.

361
00:28:04,907 --> 00:28:08,003
Damn it, Dexter.

362
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:11,392
<i>What have I done now ?

363
00:28:12,808 --> 00:28:16,671
<i>And why can't I get that neat stack
of body parts out of my head?

364
00:28:17,466 --> 00:28:20,162
<i>No blood.

365
00:28:20,808 --> 00:28:24,542
Why did I touch her that way?

366
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,750
<i>I need to get back to my work.

367
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:33,263
<i>Jaworski's website,
"scream-bitch-scream" --

368
00:28:33,305 --> 00:28:36,531
<i>the mother of all rape sites.

369
00:28:51,678 --> 00:28:55,260
<i>That's it.
He's definitely the one.

370
00:28:57,066 --> 00:28:58,682
<i>Now it's just a matter of time

371
00:28:58,706 --> 00:29:02,910
<i>before he becomes a drop of blood
in my glass-slide collection.

372
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,603
<i>But I have to wait.

373
00:29:05,637 --> 00:29:08,402
<i>I have to be careful

374
00:29:08,507 --> 00:29:10,960
<i>and follow the code of Harry.

375
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,262
Hey, dad.

376
00:29:27,137 --> 00:29:29,482
- I can explain.
- You and I had an understanding.

377
00:29:29,505 --> 00:29:32,362
Whenever you get an urge,
you come to me,

378
00:29:32,408 --> 00:29:34,251
you tell me,
and we deal with it together.

379
00:29:34,296 --> 00:29:36,553
- I do tell you, dad.
- The hell you do!

380
00:29:36,638 --> 00:29:40,821
- There's blood on this knife.
- Animals. I find animals, that's all.

381
00:29:40,855 --> 00:29:43,471
Are you sure?
Are you telling me the truth?

382
00:29:43,537 --> 00:29:45,080
Yes!

383
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:47,833
I thought we had
this under control.

384
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:59,331
You still don't remember
anything from before,

385
00:29:59,366 --> 00:30:02,760
- you know, before we took you in?
- No.

386
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:07,231
Is that why I have these urges?

387
00:30:10,006 --> 00:30:13,272
What happened changed
something inside you.

388
00:30:13,537 --> 00:30:16,760
It got into you too early.

389
00:30:17,305 --> 00:30:20,400
I'm afraid your urge to kill
is only gonna get stronger.

390
00:30:20,437 --> 00:30:23,201
You're saying I'll be
like this forever.

391
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:28,300
You're a good kid, Dex.
You are.

392
00:30:29,438 --> 00:30:32,572
Otherwise, it would have been
a lot worse than animals.

393
00:30:35,006 --> 00:30:38,161
Okay?
We can't stop this.

394
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:40,761
But maybe...

395
00:30:42,935 --> 00:30:47,602
We can do something
to channel it.

396
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:53,521
- Use it for good.
- How could it ever be good?

397
00:30:53,565 --> 00:30:56,733
Son, there are people out
there who do really bad things.

398
00:30:57,588 --> 00:31:03,131
Terrible people.
And the police can't catch them all.

399
00:31:06,338 --> 00:31:10,322
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

400
00:31:10,427 --> 00:31:14,302
You're saying
they deserve it.

401
00:31:14,328 --> 00:31:16,702
That's right.

402
00:31:17,338 --> 00:31:20,293
But, of course,
you have to learn how to spot them,

403
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:25,111
how to cover your tracks.

404
00:31:25,736 --> 00:31:28,000
But I can teach you.

405
00:31:29,507 --> 00:31:32,901
- Dad...
- It's okay, Dex.

406
00:31:33,447 --> 00:31:38,463
You can't help what happened to you,
but you can make the best of it.

407
00:31:38,508 --> 00:31:43,460
Remember this forever --
you are my son,

408
00:31:43,507 --> 00:31:47,160
you are not alone,
and you are loved.

409
00:31:49,517 --> 00:31:51,651
Okay.

410
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:55,031
<i>Preparation is vital.

411
00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:57,601
<i>No detail can be overlooked.

412
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:05,833
<i>And the ritual is intoxicating.

413
00:32:13,937 --> 00:32:17,032
<i>Duct tape...

414
00:32:17,056 --> 00:32:19,453
<i>Rubber sheets...

415
00:32:20,168 --> 00:32:23,632
<i>Necessary tools of the trade.

416
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:30,503
You can't bullshit me, Dex.
Help me out.

417
00:32:30,728 --> 00:32:32,703
Laguerta has me
interviewing hookers.

418
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:35,081
It's a waste of time.

419
00:32:35,665 --> 00:32:40,642
Deb, if he was
interrupted... Think.

420
00:32:41,968 --> 00:32:43,581
Jesus Christ, right.

421
00:32:43,597 --> 00:32:46,353
Because then how do you have
time to wrap all the pieces?

422
00:32:46,387 --> 00:32:49,442
She's dumber than the boat people.
Throw her a fucking raft.

423
00:32:49,507 --> 00:32:52,471
But now we have a fourth body,
and the cuts were different.

424
00:32:52,578 --> 00:32:55,882
And that's telling us a story.
The ritual is changing.

425
00:32:57,506 --> 00:33:00,301
He's looking for some kind of
inspiration and not finding it.

426
00:33:00,337 --> 00:33:02,402
So he keeps doing it
until he gets it right.

427
00:33:02,437 --> 00:33:04,063
I could be wrong.

428
00:33:05,806 --> 00:33:08,733
So how the hell was your
date with Rita last night?

429
00:33:08,766 --> 00:33:10,002
Great.

430
00:33:10,037 --> 00:33:11,971
You should try it sometime.
You need a life.

431
00:33:12,007 --> 00:33:16,252
Well, find me a guy I can trust.
I need a transfer to Homicide, bro,

432
00:33:16,307 --> 00:33:17,823
then we'll see about a life.

433
00:33:18,005 --> 00:33:18,961
I understand that.

434
00:33:18,986 --> 00:33:20,600
It certainly would sound
better for the kids to say,

435
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:22,250
"mommy's on Homicide."

436
00:33:23,258 --> 00:33:25,700
- Don't make me hit you.
- Come on.

437
00:33:26,408 --> 00:33:29,262
Then we could talk about more
little Morgans, nephews and nieces.

438
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:32,910
- What's wrong with that?
- You sound like mom.

439
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:37,300
I just -- tell me what you know
about cell crystallization.

440
00:33:37,755 --> 00:33:40,182
- What do you mean?
- I heard the coroner say it last night.

441
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:43,840
He was talking about
that dead... headless chick.

442
00:33:43,945 --> 00:33:47,992
- You got that look in your eye.
- I was there before you,

443
00:33:48,098 --> 00:33:51,800
and I noticed this body looked
different than the other ones.

444
00:33:52,256 --> 00:33:54,180
The pieces were cold.

445
00:33:54,205 --> 00:33:57,230
But meat-packing cold.

446
00:33:57,966 --> 00:34:00,002
Is that what cell
crystallization means?

447
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,313
<i>My god, why didn't I think of that?
It's beautiful.

448
00:34:03,315 --> 00:34:06,860
Dex.
What are you thinking?

449
00:34:06,905 --> 00:34:10,761
Sorry.
That makes sense.

450
00:34:10,805 --> 00:34:12,662
Cold.

451
00:34:14,705 --> 00:34:17,200
It slows the flow of blood.

452
00:34:17,477 --> 00:34:20,202
Why the hell is that important?

453
00:34:20,257 --> 00:34:24,413
- It's just a feeling.
- That's not good enough.

454
00:34:25,206 --> 00:34:28,831
I got to show Laguerta and her boys.
They're making fun of me.

455
00:34:29,387 --> 00:34:32,533
They're saying the only way
I can close a case is on my back.

456
00:34:33,098 --> 00:34:37,532
I got to get out of Vice.
Dex, please, you got to --

457
00:34:37,568 --> 00:34:39,231
Refrigerated truck.

458
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:43,293
What the fuck are
you talking about?

459
00:34:43,967 --> 00:34:46,351
A refrigerated truck.

460
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,401
He wants a cold environment

461
00:34:50,867 --> 00:34:53,283
to slow the flow of blood,

462
00:34:53,937 --> 00:34:58,782
clean and mobile so he can
dump the garbage afterwards.

463
00:34:59,607 --> 00:35:01,791
So I'm looking for a
refrigerated truck now?

464
00:35:01,817 --> 00:35:04,452
Probably a stolen one.

465
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:08,653
You think there are a lot
of stolen trucks out there?

466
00:35:08,767 --> 00:35:12,332
Are you nuts?
In Miami?

467
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:18,401
Choir... kids... Just
do something.

468
00:35:18,515 --> 00:35:20,503
Just find my husband.

469
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:23,612
Ma'am, the detectives are
looking into everything.

470
00:35:24,737 --> 00:35:27,331
<i>I'm pretty sure I
covered all my tracks.

471
00:35:27,368 --> 00:35:31,963
- What do you care about that woman?
- I don't. I was just --

472
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:35,192
You like when women cry?
You like that?

473
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,101
What's your thing, psycho?

474
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:38,872
I was just heading to
the briefing room.

475
00:35:38,907 --> 00:35:40,852
You got no call to be in there,
so flee.

476
00:35:40,865 --> 00:35:43,733
Lieutenant, this fucking
guy doesn't belong.

477
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,393
I'm still waiting for
his spatter report

478
00:35:45,405 --> 00:35:48,331
on the cokehead murders --
Go do that.

479
00:35:48,367 --> 00:35:50,562
It's okay.
I don't want to upset anybody.

480
00:35:50,605 --> 00:35:53,553
He can stay.
I'd like your input,

481
00:35:53,576 --> 00:35:56,111
and we'll discuss your
case after the meeting.

482
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,700
How about we get started?

483
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:01,572
- ¿Encontráste algo?
- Nada todavía.

484
00:36:01,608 --> 00:36:04,012
- Hazme un favor y quítate la gorra.
- Discúlpame.

485
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:16,602
- You ready?
- I'm gonna shame this bitch.

486
00:36:16,637 --> 00:36:19,781
Just state your case clean and easy.
You'll be the hero.

487
00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:22,931
Okay, settle down.

488
00:36:22,968 --> 00:36:25,501
Now, has anyone tracked
down that witness?

489
00:36:28,206 --> 00:36:31,762
Come on, people.
Someone needs to find something here.

490
00:36:31,908 --> 00:36:36,150
- Lieutenant Laguerta?
- Officer Morgan.

491
00:36:36,206 --> 00:36:38,352
I didn't recognize you
with your clothes on.

492
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:44,962
I have an idea,
something in a different direction.

493
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:46,962
An idea?

494
00:36:48,765 --> 00:36:50,741
Well, please, share it with us.

495
00:36:55,117 --> 00:36:58,571
- Cell crystallization.
- Excuse me?

496
00:36:58,607 --> 00:37:01,123
A little more confidence,
please.

497
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:04,302
On the last victim,

498
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:06,772
I'd like to check and see
if any refrigerated trucks

499
00:37:06,806 --> 00:37:11,681
have been stolen in
the last... week or so.

500
00:37:12,206 --> 00:37:15,522
Refrigerated trucks
like ice-cream trucks?

501
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:21,831
No, not ice-cream trucks.

502
00:37:21,866 --> 00:37:23,330
A refrigerated vehicle

503
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:25,833
that could cause that
kind of tissue damage,

504
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,652
a refrigerated truck that's...

505
00:37:28,766 --> 00:37:32,060
...mobile so he'll be
harder to catch,

506
00:37:32,137 --> 00:37:37,431
a refrigerated truck that
might give us a lead.

507
00:37:40,598 --> 00:37:43,452
That's very interesting,
very creative.

508
00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:45,182
Let's keep looking
for the witness, okay?

509
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,502
We know that he or she is out there.
The forensic evidence,

510
00:37:47,638 --> 00:37:49,672
the interrupted cut proves
that there was an eyewitness.

511
00:37:49,706 --> 00:37:52,162
Now, somebody out
there saw something,

512
00:37:52,205 --> 00:37:54,712
so let's concentrate on
finding that person, okay?

513
00:37:54,737 --> 00:37:55,361
But --

514
00:37:55,387 --> 00:37:58,113
Just keep talking
to all your hookers.

515
00:37:59,607 --> 00:38:02,100
That's all for today.

516
00:38:08,637 --> 00:38:12,411
What the fuck was I supposed to say?
The only reason I'm in here

517
00:38:12,536 --> 00:38:14,721
is because the captain said
they had to let me in.

518
00:38:14,807 --> 00:38:17,392
But he didn't say they
had to listen to you.

519
00:38:17,405 --> 00:38:18,801
Well, right again.

520
00:38:18,845 --> 00:38:21,731
So say adiós to my career.
I'm gonna die a meter maid.

521
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:25,542
Stop it. Deb, there's another way.
Find the truck.

522
00:38:29,866 --> 00:38:34,330
Excuse me, Dexter...
My office, please.

523
00:38:41,467 --> 00:38:43,662
What the hell?

524
00:38:46,668 --> 00:38:49,160
What the fuck?

525
00:38:50,616 --> 00:38:53,203
Are you boning her?

526
00:38:53,228 --> 00:38:55,690
- No.
- Oh, my god!

527
00:38:55,736 --> 00:38:58,513
- Deb, wait.
- Shut up.

528
00:39:02,068 --> 00:39:03,800
It had nothing to
do with drugs.

529
00:39:03,837 --> 00:39:05,901
L.T., this is a waste
of our damn time.

530
00:39:05,936 --> 00:39:07,682
I think sergeant
Doakes is right.

531
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:09,932
I read the other reports,
all the other forensic analysis.

532
00:39:09,965 --> 00:39:13,171
Everyone agrees the cokehead murders
had nothing to do with cocaine.

533
00:39:13,206 --> 00:39:14,933
It was a crime of passion.

534
00:39:14,968 --> 00:39:17,650
The murderer came to kill
the woman, not the dealer.

535
00:39:17,678 --> 00:39:19,003
He did him quick and
got him out of the way.

536
00:39:19,036 --> 00:39:21,570
But he sure as hell took his
sweet time slicing up that lady,

537
00:39:21,606 --> 00:39:24,003
and you don't do that
unless you have a close,

538
00:39:24,035 --> 00:39:28,750
personal relationship with someone.
Probably an ex-boyfriend.

539
00:39:28,835 --> 00:39:30,903
That's who I'd look for.

540
00:39:33,655 --> 00:39:35,083
Okay.

541
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:39,492
It's a bit of a push, but,
sergeant, you should check it out.

542
00:39:47,268 --> 00:39:50,200
I'm watching you, motherfucker.

543
00:40:03,537 --> 00:40:05,962
<i>Jaworski's been coming
here for weeks --

544
00:40:06,007 --> 00:40:08,563
<i>likes to steal all
the copper plumbing.

545
00:40:08,605 --> 00:40:11,091
<i>There's good money in that.

546
00:40:11,906 --> 00:40:15,402
<i>No security guards --
that's good.

547
00:41:19,568 --> 00:41:21,580
- Fuck!
- Talk.

548
00:41:21,597 --> 00:41:24,381
- What do you mean?
- I think you know what I mean.

549
00:41:24,407 --> 00:41:28,010
No. Oh, god.

550
00:41:28,036 --> 00:41:30,852
Talk to me about Jane Saunders.

551
00:41:31,468 --> 00:41:33,932
Okay.
I did her.

552
00:41:33,968 --> 00:41:37,612
- How?
- In a movie -- snuff film.

553
00:41:37,636 --> 00:41:41,330
- But I'm not sorry.
- Of course not.

554
00:41:42,506 --> 00:41:45,400
No, I'm not sorry, either.

555
00:42:07,306 --> 00:42:12,962
- Hello?
- Hey. I'm -- I'm sorry.

556
00:42:13,006 --> 00:42:16,132
I mean,
I'm sorry about the other night,

557
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:22,013
but... look, Dex, I really,
really need to see you.

558
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:26,932
So can you --
can you come by later,

559
00:42:26,965 --> 00:42:29,262
you know, just for,
like, a little while?

560
00:42:29,306 --> 00:42:31,702
I mean, I'm really --

561
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:36,132
All right.
What are you doing now?

562
00:42:36,567 --> 00:42:38,460
I'm just finishing
up a little project,

563
00:42:38,505 --> 00:42:40,913
but I'll come by later.

564
00:42:40,918 --> 00:42:43,192
Okay, bye.

565
00:42:58,136 --> 00:43:00,533
<i>All in all,
it was a good night.

566
00:43:00,768 --> 00:43:04,432
<i>One less amateur filmmaker
polluting the internet.

567
00:43:36,038 --> 00:43:38,071
No way !

568
00:45:13,567 --> 00:45:15,802
Give us a minute.

569
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,863
Hanging in there?

570
00:45:19,067 --> 00:45:21,710
This will teach me to tailgate.

571
00:45:21,858 --> 00:45:23,702
Let's go over this again.

572
00:45:23,738 --> 00:45:27,602
- I'm all yours.
- So all the ice trucks in Miami --

573
00:45:28,038 --> 00:45:31,732
- bit of a coincidence, don't you think?
- Sure, during business hours.

574
00:45:31,907 --> 00:45:34,402
But this time of night,
a truck like that sticks out.

575
00:45:34,438 --> 00:45:36,300
And you followed it.

576
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,952
That's right.

577
00:45:38,965 --> 00:45:43,282
- You never saw the driver?
- Just high beams and a flying head.

578
00:45:43,938 --> 00:45:48,000
So then he must have already had
the head with him in the front seat.

579
00:45:48,307 --> 00:45:51,331
That's weird.
Why would he keep it there?

580
00:45:51,366 --> 00:45:53,930
I don't know,
so he could use a carpool lane?

581
00:45:57,805 --> 00:46:01,602
It just seems odd.
Your sister has this ice-truck theory,

582
00:46:01,706 --> 00:46:04,301
and then here you
are to back it up.

583
00:46:04,336 --> 00:46:07,230
She's good, lieutenant.
You should give her a chance.

584
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:10,633
You know,
you should call me Maria.

585
00:46:10,716 --> 00:46:14,100
But I'll tell you who's good --
you are.

586
00:46:14,136 --> 00:46:17,163
Doakes picked up the killer
in the cokehead murders.

587
00:46:17,406 --> 00:46:20,242
You were right.
It was her boyfriend.

588
00:46:20,448 --> 00:46:23,052
Of course, Doakes
still hates you.

589
00:46:23,427 --> 00:46:24,951
Of course.

590
00:46:28,037 --> 00:46:30,611
Tell me, Dexter,

591
00:46:30,647 --> 00:46:33,203
how did you get
to be so smart?

592
00:46:35,807 --> 00:46:38,481
Lots of sleep.

593
00:46:41,606 --> 00:46:43,851
Is it okay if I fill out
that report tomorrow?

594
00:46:45,468 --> 00:46:48,530
Sure thing.
You're tired.

595
00:46:50,068 --> 00:46:54,562
- Good night, lieutenant.
- I'll catch you later.

596
00:47:09,067 --> 00:47:13,113
Dex.
It's been a while.

597
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:17,131
- I'm sorry.
- I was worried.

598
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,361
I didn't know what to do.
I called in sick.

599
00:47:21,037 --> 00:47:23,161
I mean...

600
00:47:25,807 --> 00:47:29,081
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I was just --

601
00:47:29,465 --> 00:47:32,832
I'm sorry.
There was another... You know.

602
00:47:41,305 --> 00:47:45,400
Look... The kids
slept over next door.

603
00:47:46,487 --> 00:47:48,462
Okay.

604
00:47:49,328 --> 00:47:54,232
- Would you like to come in?
- Okay.

605
00:47:54,268 --> 00:47:56,231
Okay.

606
00:48:08,837 --> 00:48:11,531
I don't want to lose you, Dex.

607
00:48:13,335 --> 00:48:16,102
Okay, sure.

608
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:24,332
And... well... I want you.

609
00:48:24,865 --> 00:48:26,531
I mean...

610
00:48:35,667 --> 00:48:39,233
Okay.
Thanks.

611
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:43,201
You're welcome.

612
00:49:03,168 --> 00:49:07,533
- Do you mind?
- No.

613
00:49:21,807 --> 00:49:26,590
- It could be the kids.
- Better get it, then.

614
00:49:30,638 --> 00:49:33,030
Hello?

615
00:49:33,407 --> 00:49:35,432
Cody.

616
00:49:35,468 --> 00:49:37,260
Cody, stop crying, sweetie.

617
00:49:39,866 --> 00:49:43,363
All right.
I'll come get you.

618
00:49:46,168 --> 00:49:50,263
Cody just threw up all
over Colleen's couch.

619
00:49:51,668 --> 00:49:54,502
I got to go get him.

620
00:49:58,868 --> 00:50:03,920
- Tell me we're okay.
- Better than.

621
00:50:04,777 --> 00:50:08,930
- Okay.
- Go be a good mom.

622
00:50:27,535 --> 00:50:29,903
<i>Okay, that was close.

623
00:50:32,337 --> 00:50:35,600
<i>I'll admit,
making out with Rita was...

624
00:50:35,638 --> 00:50:37,902
<i>Interesting.

625
00:50:38,147 --> 00:50:39,990
<i>But if I don't keep a lid on this,

626
00:50:40,006 --> 00:50:41,692
<i>it could be the end of us.

627
00:51:04,905 --> 00:51:09,412
<i>I suppose I should be upset,
even feel violated,

628
00:51:09,587 --> 00:51:11,841
<i>but I'm not.

629
00:51:12,145 --> 00:51:14,523
<i>No.

630
00:51:14,556 --> 00:51:16,280
<i>In fact,
I think this is a friendly message,

631
00:51:16,308 --> 00:51:19,730
<i>kind of like,
"hey, want to play?"

632
00:51:20,438 --> 00:51:23,732
<i>And, yes, I want to play.

633
00:51:23,966 --> 00:51:26,042
<i>I really, really do.
